[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning follows
[SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Corrected the wording of the 0.5.0 note about the unknown-recipe test. It said
  the test "passed by accepting a valid recipe"; it did not pass. When recipe 3
  shipped, the value that test was written to reject became valid, so the
  assertion stopped rejecting anything and the test **failed**. The sdist for
  0.5.0 carries the earlier wording and is not rebuilt: the artifacts are signed
  and published, and re-cutting a version is not an option for a wording fix.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Contract recipe 3** — the contract hash now covers the tool's declared `title`
  and its `execution` parameters (`taskSupport`). Recipe 2 folded in the output
  schema and the annotation hints but left these two uncovered, and every served
  tool in the committed capture (14/14) carries both, so a server could retitle a
  tool — display metadata a client may put in front of a user, and which a decision
  may later be recorded against — or change what its execution permits, and still
  report healthy. Recipe 3 is the current default for new declarations; recipe 2
  remains valid and its field set is unchanged, so declarations hashed under it keep
  hashing to those same values. Issue #26.
- The example pair is rebuilt under recipe 3 by re-deriving every contract hash
  from the committed captures — `python3 examples/rebuild_pair.py --recipe 3` — so
  the migration is reproducible offline rather than a hand-edited set of hashes.

### Changed
- Contract hashes in `examples/filesystem-server-*.json` and the stored per-call
  hashes in `examples/captures/*.calls.json` differ from their v0.4.x values for
  the same declarations: the recipe widened, the servers did not change. The pair's
  findings are unchanged at three, because this capture shows `title` and
  `execution` identical between the two captured versions. The gap recipe 3 closes
  is therefore pinned by a constructed mutation in the test suite, stated as a
  construction rather than implied to be evidence the capture holds.

### Fixed
- A test asserted that recipe `"3"` was rejected as an unknown recipe. When
  recipe 3 shipped, the value that test was written to reject became valid, so
  the assertion stopped rejecting anything and the test went red. The sentinel
  is now outside the known set, and the test records why: a rejected-value
  fixture stops rejecting the moment that value becomes real.
- A test asserts that every field a recipe hashes is carried by the capture's
  wire-to-declaration mapping. A field the mapping dropped would leave the hash
  covering the fallback default and reporting a contract no server served.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- The documented release-verification command named `@refs/tags/v0.2.1`, so
  copying it from the README against any later release failed with `none of the
  expected identities matched what was in the certificate`. It now takes the tag
  being verified as `$TAG`, because the signer identity *is* the workflow running
  under that tag — a fixed tag in the docs is wrong from the next release on.
- The install block said "from PyPI once published". It has been published since
  v0.4.3.

### Added
- Release verification now documents the PEP 740 build attestations carried by
  the wheel and sdist, with the command that checks them, and states what the
  check looks like when it refuses a file built by a different repository. No
  signing key exists in that path, which makes it the cheaper check for someone
  who has just run `pip install`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- Published to PyPI via GitHub OIDC trusted publishing, with build attestations
  attached. The distributions are handed to the publisher as their own artifact,
  so the checksums, SBOM and signatures stay release assets — the upload action
  rejects any non-distribution file in its payload
- Release guards: the built distributions must carry the tag version, and the
  package must report it, before anything is signed or uploaded

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- A scope-only observation is no longer assigned a recipe. The v0.4.1 default read *every* observation that states no recipe as recipe 1, including one that carries no `contract_hash` at all — so a scope-only observation on a recipe-2 declaration produced a high-severity `recipe_mismatch` asserting that a hash the evidence never carried had been "computed under recipe 1", and the summary counted that recipe as if the ledger held one. The inference now stops at the hash: no hash, no recipe claim, no verdict. Arguments on such observations are still checked against the declared input schema.
- The summary counts a recipe stated on an observation for a tool the declaration does not carry. Recipe handling ran after the undeclared-tool branch returned, so a ledger holding a recipe-1 hash on an undeclared tool was summarised as `["2"]`, contradicting the v0.4.1 guarantee that the summary lists every recipe the evidence holds.
- An unknown recipe is rejected on that path too. The same early return let `contract_recipe: "9"` on an undeclared-tool observation skip `check_recipe` entirely.

### Changed
- README and `docs/DESIGN.md`: the recipe rules are four. Rule 3 now states that the legacy default applies *where a hash exists to interpret*, and rule 4 states that a stated recipe is read wherever it appears.

All three reported by automated review of [#27](https://github.com/narko4u/mcp-evidence-validator/pull/27), which reviewed the v0.4.1 fix itself: two were introduced by that fix, and the validation bypass sat on the same path.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- A silent observation is no longer reported as contract drift. An observation written before v0.4.0 carries no `contract_recipe`, and the comparability guard only fired when a recipe was stated — so an intact pre-v0.4.0 ledger compared against a recipe-2 declaration came back with a `contract_mutated` finding against every observation it held. Silence is now read the way a silent declaration is read, as recipe 1, and the comparison is refused with a `recipe_mismatch` finding that names the one-line change which judges that ledger under the recipe that produced it.
- The report `summary` lists every recipe the ledger holds, not only the declaration's. A refused comparison was summarised as `["2"]` while the evidence it summarised contained a recipe-1 hash.
- Per-call contract hashes are derived from the manifest the **call session** served. `examples/capture_mcp_server.py` persists that session's manifest beside the calls and `build_pair` derives from it; a capture that cannot supply its own session's manifest stops the derivation instead of borrowing a `tools/list` session's declaration, which could assert a contract the call never ran under.

### Changed
- `examples/captures/filesystem-server-2026.8.31.calls.json` carries the manifest its own session served (`tools`). The capture was re-taken from the real `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2026.8.31`, and every contract hash it yields is unchanged from v0.4.0: what moved is the provenance of the evidence, not the evidence.
- README and `docs/DESIGN.md`: the recipe rules are three, now covering silent observations and the refusal path.

All three reported by automated review of [#25](https://github.com/narko4u/mcp-evidence-validator/pull/25).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- **Contract recipes.** A contract hash now travels with the recipe that produced it: a declaration states `contract_recipe`, an observation may state the recipe its `contract_hash` was computed under, the report's `summary` lists every recipe in play, and `verify` prints them for a ledger. Recipe 2 folds the declared output schema and the tool's MCP annotation hints into the contract; recipe 1 is the original four fields (`name`, `description`, `input_schema`, `permissions`).
- A `recipe_mismatch` check: an observation whose recipe differs from the declaration's is refused rather than reported as drift, because two hashes computed different ways are not evidence of change in either direction.
- `examples/rebuild_pair.py`: re-derives a committed example pair, and the per-call hashes in its capture, from the raw `tools/list` replies. No Node.js, no network.
- `NOTICE`: attribution for the Apache-2.0 licence.
- `examples/filesystem-server-declared.json` and `examples/filesystem-server-observed.json`: a declared-vs-observed pair captured from a real MCP server, `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`, declaring `2026.1.14` and observing `2026.8.31` (closes [#17](https://github.com/narko4u/mcp-evidence-validator/issues/17)).
- `examples/capture_mcp_server.py`: starts a published MCP server over stdio, records `tools/list` and real `tools/call` replies, and writes the pair. The raw replies are committed under `examples/captures/`.
- `tests/test_filesystem_example.py`: recomputes every contract hash in the pair from the raw captures, runs the pair through the validator and the CLI, and asserts the pair is exactly what the captures derive.
- Tests: legacy declarations still hash under recipe 1, recipe 2 covers an output-schema-only and an annotation-only change, recipe precedence, rejection of unknown recipes, recipe mismatch, and the recipe-1 blindness that motivated the change — pinned rather than deleted.

### Changed
- **Recipe 2 is the default for new declarations.** A declaration that states no recipe keeps hashing under recipe 1, so every ledger issued before this release still verifies and nothing already published changes meaning.
- Ledger format `0.2` → `0.3`. Additive: block shape, the chain, and the dump/load round trip are unchanged, and a `0.2` ledger still loads and still verifies.
- The filesystem example pair is hashed under recipe 2, with every contract hash re-derived from the raw captures. It reports **three** findings where it previously reported one: the `2026.8.31` release added an `openWorldHint` annotation to every tool it serves, which moved the contracts of `read_text_file` and `get_file_info` while leaving them byte-identical under recipe 1.
- README: example table gained a recipe column; the filesystem example's finding count and its cause are stated; new "Contract recipes" section; owner and related-work context.
- `docs/DESIGN.md`: new §2.2.1 on recipes and migration, a recipe-mismatch row in the check table, ledger self-description notes, and component paths corrected from the prototype layout to `src/`.

### Fixed
- The contract no longer misses a server that changes only what it returns, or only the hints it publishes about its own side effects — the gap reported in [#23](https://github.com/narko4u/mcp-evidence-validator/issues/23).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- A self-describing ledger verified three forgeries clean, all of which now fail: a chain replayed over a rewritten record, a truncated chain that dropped the last block (and with it a high-severity finding), and a chain whose published `prev_hash` and `index` were falsified. `verify` now requires the head digest recorded outside the ledger and checks every published field against the chain walk. Reported by [@astrogilda](https://github.com/astrogilda) in [#20](https://github.com/narko4u/mcp-evidence-validator/issues/20); fixed in [#21](https://github.com/narko4u/mcp-evidence-validator/pull/21).

### Security
- The README claim that a changed record "invalidates every record after it" held only for a naive edit. It is replaced by the accuracy requirement: a chain read on its own proves ordering to whoever holds the file and nothing to anyone else. See the tamper-evidence note in `SECURITY.md` and `Ledger.verify(UNANCHORED)`.

### Changed
- **Breaking.** `verify` requires `--expected-head`, the head digest recorded outside the ledger. A ledger that does not reach that head is refused.
- **Breaking.** `Ledger.verify` takes `expected_head` as an argument. Pass the new `UNANCHORED` constant for chain self-consistency alone.
- `Ledger.verify` compares each block's published `prev_hash` and `index` against the chain walk and reports every disagreement, instead of recomputing both and comparing only `hash`.
- `Ledger.verify` reports every problem it finds rather than returning at the first hash mismatch.

### Added
- `Ledger.head()`, and `validate --head-out PATH` to write that digest to a separate file. `validate` also prints it to stderr.
- `tests/test_ledger_forgery.py`: a full-rewrite forgery, a tail truncation that removes a high-severity finding, and a ledger whose published `prev_hash` and `index` are falsified. Each verified clean before this change.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- Release workflow with sigstore keyless signing (SHA256SUMS + cosign signature)
- OpenSSF baseline level 2 readiness: MAINTAINERS.md, threat assessment, DCO check, least-privilege CI permissions

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- Installable package (`pyproject.toml`, src/ layout, `mcp-ev-validate` console script)
- `validate` subcommand: compare a declared manifest against observed runtime records
- `verify` subcommand: replay the SHA-256 hash chain and report any corruption
- Test suite (pytest, 20 tests) covering fingerprinting, ledger chaining, tamper detection, and CLI entry points
- GitHub Actions CI (Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Security policy (SECURITY.md) with private reporting and 90-day coordinated disclosure
- Contributing guide and Code of Conduct

### Security
- Ledger integrity depends on SHA-256 over canonical JSON; tampering with any
  prior record invalidates all subsequent records (verified by the test suite).
- No runtime dependencies; no secrets or credentials are stored in the ledger.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- Prototype: declared-vs-observed evidence model (declarations, contracts, observations, findings)
- Prototype hash-chain ledger (`prototype/ledger.py`, `prototype/fingerprint.py`)
- Design document (docs/DESIGN.md)
