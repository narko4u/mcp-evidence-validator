# VEX — Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange

Status: current as of v0.2.1 (2026-08-18). Reviewed before each release.

This document states the exploitability status of known vulnerabilities in
the software components of this project, per the OSPS VM-04.02 control.
"Not affected" means the vulnerable component is present in the supply chain
but the vulnerable code path cannot be reached or does not affect the
shipped artifact.

## Component inventory

| Component | Type | Version | Runtime? |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| `mcp_evidence_validator` | Shipped package | 0.2.x | Yes |
| Python standard library | Runtime | 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12 | Yes |
| pytest / coverage | Test-only | pinned in CI | No |
| ruff / bandit | Lint/SAST-only | pinned in CI | No |
| build / setuptools | Build-only | pinned in CI | No |
| GitHub Actions (checkout, setup-python, cosign, gh-release) | CI-only | pinned by SHA | No |

## Statements

| Component | Vulnerability | Status | Justification |
|-----------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| `mcp_evidence_validator` | (any) | Not affected | No network listeners, no server component, no runtime dependencies, no credential storage; the only external input is JSON observations supplied by the operator |
| Python standard library | (any) | Under assessment | The shipped artifact is pure-stdlib; any stdlib CVE is assessed at release time against reachable code paths before a release ships |
| Test/lint/build/CI components | (any) | Not affected | Not shipped to end users; only ever run in ephemeral CI on trusted inputs |

## Change policy

- This VEX is updated whenever a new component is added, a vulnerability is
  reported, or a release is prepared.
- New releases must not ship while a High or Medium severity finding in a
  reachable component is unresolved (see `SECURITY.md` remediation
  thresholds).
