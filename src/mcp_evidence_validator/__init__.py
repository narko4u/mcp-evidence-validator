"""MCP Evidence Validator - declared-vs-observed evidence for MCP servers.

Validates what an MCP server *declares* against what it *actually does* and
produces a tamper-evident SHA-256 hash-chain ledger for auditors.

Public API:
    fingerprint(value)          -> canonical SHA-256 fingerprint
    Ledger                      -> append-only hash chain with
                                   head() and verify(expected_head)
    validate_batch(declared, observed) -> (findings, summary)
