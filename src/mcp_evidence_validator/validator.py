"""Core validation logic: declared vs observed MCP server state.

Produces findings for the declared-vs-observed gap and a human-readable
summary. The caller is responsible for ledger bookkeeping.

Contract recipes
----------------

A contract hash answers "has this declaration changed?". Which fields of the
declaration are folded into that hash is the *recipe*, and a hash is only
meaningful together with it. Recipe is carried in the evidence rather than
assumed:

* a declaration states ``contract_recipe`` (manifest level, overridable per
  tool),
* an observation may state the ``contract_recipe`` its ``contract_hash`` was
  computed under, and one that states none is read as recipe 1 for the same
  reason a silent declaration is: silence is not "unknown recipe", it is what a
  ledger issued before 0.4.0 looks like. Reading it as unknown would skip the
  comparability check below and report two hashes that differ only by
  construction as contract drift.

A declaration that states no recipe is recipe 1 - the four-field contract that
every ledger issued before 0.4.0 carries. Legacy declarations must keep hashing
to the values already committed in those ledgers, so the default is the legacy
recipe and new declarations opt up explicitly. Comparing a hash from one recipe
against a re-derivation under another would be a false verdict in either
direction, so the two are never mixed: a recipe disagreement is reported as its
own finding and the mutation comparison is skipped.
